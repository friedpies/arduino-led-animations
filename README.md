# LED animations for Arduino

A set of 1-Dimensional LED strip patterns for Arduino that I've  written. I've found myself working on a lot of projects where I've needed to add some interesting dynamic patterns to an LED ring or strip and wanted to put them all in one place.

# ProtoRing
A simple 3D-printable enclosure to arrange an LED strip into a ring. Designed to be used with WS2812 or APA102 strips.
